# Bank-Application
A Bank application written in Java that performs the basic functions of a normal banking application(assuming that the money inserted is hypothetical): withdrawing, despositing, transferring money, among others. There are also features that use the SQL database to create/modify user accounts in the system. These credentials in the database are used to login to the application, and will determine whether the user is a customer, or a banker employee, and will display the right window depending on their role.
